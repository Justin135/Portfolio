            <h2>About Justin</h2>
        
          <p> I am currently in college and I wanted to expand my knowledge outside of my major. I wanted to explore many different options that catches my interest. Coding was something that I was interested in and I knew it was something that I was determined to learn. <strong>Thinkful</strong> had a well structured program which made me become a Thinkful student. I will be looking forward to working with other people in the future! </p> <p>My hobbies are: Playing games, listening to music, and spending time with my family.</p>
